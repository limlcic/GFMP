The code in this package is only for academic communication.
The code is for building gene-gene network and then devide it into modules.

Dependent:
The glasso software used here is from Rob Tibshirani , the Matlab package is available at  http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/glasso/index.html 

Installing:
The glasso needs compiling by fortran compiler. We provided the compiled
binary file for windows x64 and linux x64, but the other platforms need 
compiling. To compile glasso, please make sure the right installion of 
a fortran compiler (the related instruction could be found in  
http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/upgrading-mex-files-to-use-64-bit-api.html)
Then type 
mex glasso.F

Usage:
The code is for three usage:
1.  If your need to use raw data for module partition, you need to do the 
    t-test at first, for example:
    [ data, symbol] = ttest_for_raw_data(data,symbol,0.05 )
    Then you can do network building and module partition, for example:
    [ out ] = build_network_and_divide( symbol,data,0.1 , 1, 0.1, 20)

2.  If you selected the gene previously, then you can do network building
    and module partition directly, for example:
    [ out ] = build_network_and_divide( symbol,data,0.1 , 1, 0.1, 20)

3.  If you built a network, then you can devide it into modules, for example:
    [ out ] = divide_network( network,symbol,20  )
